## Overview

The goal of tidyr is to help you create __tidy data__. Tidy data is data where:

1. Every column is variable.
1. Every row is an observation.
1. Every cell is a single value.

Tidy data describes a standard way of storing data that is used wherever possible throughout the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org). If you ensure that your data is tidy, you'll spend less time fighting with the tools and more time working on your analysis. Learn more about tidy data in `vignette("tidy-data")`.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get tidyr is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just tidyr:
install.packages("tidyr")

# Or the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/tidyr")
```

## Cheatsheet

## Getting started

```{r}
library(tidyr)
```

tidyr functions fall into five main categories:

* "Pivotting" which converts between long and wide forms. tidyr 1.0.0 
  introduces `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`, replacing the older 
  `spread()` and `gather()` functions. See `vignette("pivot")` for more 
  details.
  
* "Rectangling", which turns deeply nested lists (as from JSON) into tidy
  tibbles. See `unnest_longer()`, `unnest_wider()`, `hoist()`, and 
  `vignette("rectangle")` for more details.
  
* Nesting converts grouped data to a form where each group becomes a
  single row containing a nested data frame, and unnesting does the opposite.
  See `nest()`, `unnest()`, and  `vignette("nest")` for more details.

* Splitting and combining character columns. Use `separate()` and `extract()` 
  to pull a single character column into multiple columns; use `unite()` to
  combine multiple columns into a single character column.

* Make implicit missing values explicit with `complete()`; make explicit 
  missing values implicit with `drop_na()`; replace missing values with
  next/previous value with `fill()`, or a known value with `replace_na()`.

## Related work

tidyr replaces reshape2 (2010-2014) and reshape (2005-2010). Somewhat counterintuitively, each iteration of the package has done less. tidyr is designed specifically for tidying data, not general reshaping (reshape2), or the general aggregation (reshape). 

[data.table](http://r-datatable.com/) provides high-performance implementations of `melt()` and `dcast()`

If you'd like to read more about data reshaping from a CS perspective, I'd recommend the following three papers:

* [Wrangler: Interactive visual specification of data transformation scripts](http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/wrangler)

* [An interactive framework for data cleaning](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2000/CSD-00-1110.pdf) (Potter's wheel)

* [On efficiently implementing SchemaSQL on a SQL database system](https://www.vldb.org/conf/1999/P45.pdf)

To guide your reading, here's a translation between the terminology used in different places:

| tidyr        | gather  | spread |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| reshape(2)   | melt    | cast   |
| spreadsheets | unpivot | pivot  | 
| databases    | fold    | unfold |
