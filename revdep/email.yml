release_details: >
  This release includes breaking changes to nest() and unnest() in order
  to increase consistency across existing functions. This unfortunately
  causes some packages to break, so we've prepared an extensive transition
  guide to help with the change:

  (the vignette it also includes general advice on using tidyr in a package)

  If you have any problems please feel to reach out to us so we can help.
