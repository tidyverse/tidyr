\title{Spread a key-value pair across multiple columns}
\usage{
spread(data, key, value, fill = NA, convert = FALSE, drop = TRUE, sep = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{key, value}{<\code{\link[=tidyr_tidy_select]{tidy-select}}> Columns to use
for \code{key} and \code{value}.}

\item{fill}{If set, missing values will be replaced with this value. Note
that there are two types of missingness in the input: explicit missing
values (i.e. \code{NA}), and implicit missings, rows that simply aren't
present. Both types of missing value will be replaced by \code{fill}.}

\item{convert}{If \code{TRUE}, \code{\link[=type.convert]{type.convert()}} with \code{asis =
  TRUE} will be run on each of the new columns. This is useful if the value
column was a mix of variables that was coerced to a string. If the class of
the value column was factor or date, note that will not be true of the new
columns that are produced, which are coerced to character before type
conversion.}

\item{drop}{If \code{FALSE}, will keep factor levels that don't appear in the
data, filling in missing combinations with \code{fill}.}

\item{sep}{If \code{NULL}, the column names will be taken from the values of
\code{key} variable. If non-\code{NULL}, the column names will be given
by \code{"<key_name><sep><key_value>"}.}

Development on \code{spread()} is complete, and for new code we recommend
switching to \code{pivot_wider()}, which is easier to use, more featureful, and
still under active development.
\code{df \%>\% spread(key, value)} is equivalent to
\code{df \%>\% pivot_wider(names_from = key, values_from = value)}

See more details in \code{vignette("pivot")}.

\examples{
stocks <- tibble(
  time = as.Date("2009-01-01") + 0:9,
  X = rnorm(10, 0, 1),
  Y = rnorm(10, 0, 2),
  Z = rnorm(10, 0, 4)
)
stocksm <- stocks \%>\% gather(stock, price, -time)
stocksm \%>\% spread(stock, price)
stocksm \%>\% spread(time, price)

# Spread and gather are complements
df <- tibble(x = c("a", "b"), y = c(3, 4), z = c(5, 6))
df \%>\%
  spread(x, y) \%>\%
  gather("x", "y", a:b, na.rm = TRUE)

# Use 'convert = TRUE' to produce variables of mixed type
df <- tibble(
  row = rep(c(1, 51), each = 3),
  var = rep(c("Sepal.Length", "Species", "Species_num"), 2),
  value = c(5.1, "setosa", 1, 7.0, "versicolor", 2)
)
df \%>\% spread(var, value) \%>\% str()
df \%>\% spread(var, value, convert = TRUE) \%>\% str()
}
