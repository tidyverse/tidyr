\usage{
pivot_wider(
  data,
  id_cols = NULL,
  names_from = name,
  names_prefix = "",
  names_sep = "_",
  names_glue = NULL,
  names_sort = FALSE,
  names_repair = "check_unique",
  values_from = value,
  values_fill = NULL,
  values_fn = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame to pivot.}

\item{id_cols}{<\code{\link[=tidyr_tidy_select]{tidy-select}}> A set of columns that
uniquely identifies each observation. Defaults to all columns in \code{data}
except for the columns specified in \code{names_from} and \code{values_from}.
Typically used when you have redundant variables, i.e. variables whose
values are perfectly correlated with existing variables.}

\item{names_from, values_from}{<\code{\link[=tidyr_tidy_select]{tidy-select}}> A pair of
arguments describing which column (or columns) to get the name of the
output column (\code{names_from}), and which column (or columns) to get the
cell values from (\code{values_from}).

If \code{values_from} contains multiple values, the value will be added to the
front of the output column.}

\item{names_prefix}{String added to the start of every variable name. This is
particularly useful if \code{names_from} is a numeric vector and you want to
create syntactic variable names.}

\item{names_sep}{If \code{names_from} or \code{values_from} contains multiple
variables, this will be used to join their values together into a single
string to use as a column name.}

\item{names_glue}{Instead of \code{names_sep} and \code{names_prefix}, you can supply
a glue specification that uses the \code{names_from} columns (and special
\code{.value}) to create custom column names.}

\item{names_sort}{Should the column names be sorted? If \code{FALSE}, the default,
column names are ordered by first appearance.}

\item{names_repair}{What happens if the output has invalid column names?
The default, \code{"check_unique"} is to error if the columns are duplicated.
Use \code{"minimal"} to allow duplicates in the output, or \code{"unique"} to
de-duplicated by adding numeric suffixes. See \code{\link[vctrs:vec_as_names]{vctrs::vec_as_names()}}
for more options.}

\item{values_fill}{Optionally, a (scalar) value that specifies what each
\code{value} should be filled in with when missing.

This can be a named list if you want to apply different aggregations
to different value columns.}

\item{values_fn}{Optionally, a function applied to the \code{value} in each cell
in the output. You will typically use this when the combination of
\code{id_cols} and \code{value} column does not uniquely identify an observation.

This can be a named list if you want to apply different aggregations
to different value columns.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to methods.}
}
\description{
\code{pivot_wider()} "widens" data, increasing the number of columns and
decreasing the number of rows. The inverse transformation is
\code{\link[=pivot_longer]{pivot_longer()}}.

}
\details{
\code{pivot_wider()} is an updated approach to \code{\link[=spread]{spread()}}, designed to be both
simpler to use and to handle more use cases. We recommend you use
\code{pivot_wider()} for new code; \code{spread()} isn't going away but is no longer
under active development.
