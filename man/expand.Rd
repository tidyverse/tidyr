\title{Expand data frame to include all possible combinations of values}
\usage{
expand(data, ..., .name_repair = "check_unique")

crossing(..., .name_repair = "check_unique")

nesting(..., .name_repair = "check_unique")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{...}{Specification of columns to expand. Columns can be atomic vectors
or lists.
\itemize{
\item To find all unique combinations of \code{x}, \code{y} and \code{z}, including those not
present in the data, supply each variable as a separate argument:
\code{expand(df, x, y, z)}.
\item To find only the combinations that occur in the
data, use \code{nesting}: \code{expand(df, nesting(x, y, z))}.
\item You can combine the two forms. For example,
\code{expand(df, nesting(school_id, student_id), date)} would produce
a row for each present school-student combination for all possible
dates.
}

When used with factors, \code{expand()} uses the full set of levels, not just
those that appear in the data. If you want to use only the values seen in
the data, use \code{forcats::fct_drop()}.

When used with continuous variables, you may need to fill in values
that do not appear in the data: to do so use expressions like
\code{year = 2010:2020} or \code{year = full_seq(year,1)}.}

\item{.name_repair}{Treatment of problematic column names:
\itemize{
\item \code{"minimal"}: No name repair or checks, beyond basic existence,
\item \code{"unique"}: Make sure names are unique and not empty,
\item \code{"check_unique"}: (default value), no name repair, but check they are
\code{unique},
\item \code{"universal"}: Make the names \code{unique} and syntactic
\item a function: apply custom name repair (e.g., \code{.name_repair = make.names}
for names in the style of base R).
\item A purrr-style anonymous function, see \code{\link[rlang:as_function]{rlang::as_function()}}
}

This argument is passed on as \code{repair} to \code{\link[vctrs:vec_as_names]{vctrs::vec_as_names()}}.
See there for more details on these terms and the strategies used
to enforce them.}
}
\description{
\code{expand()} generates all combination of variables found in a dataset.
It is paired with \code{nesting()} and \code{crossing()} helpers. \code{crossing()}
is a wrapper around \code{\link[=expand_grid]{expand_grid()}} that de-duplicates and sorts its inputs;
\code{nesting()} is a helper that only finds combinations already present in the
data.

\code{expand()} is often useful in conjunction with joins:
\itemize{
\item use it with \code{right_join()} to convert implicit missing values to
explicit missing values (e.g., fill in gaps in your data frame).
\item use it with \code{anti_join()} to figure out which combinations are missing
(e.g., identify gaps in your data frame).
}
}
\details{
With grouped data frames, \code{expand()} operates \emph{within} each group. Because of
this, you cannot expand on a grouping column.

  type   = c("apple", "orange", "apple", "orange", "orange", "orange"),
  year   = c(2010, 2010, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2012),
  size  =  factor(

    levels = c("XS", "S", "M", "L")

# factor variable `size` are retained.

# Only combinations that already appear in the data ---------------

# Other uses -------------------------------------------------------
# Use with `full_seq()` to fill in values of continuous variables
fruits \%>\% expand(type, size, full_seq(year, 1))
fruits \%>\% expand(type, size, 2010:2013)

# Use `anti_join()` to determine which observations are missing
all <- fruits \%>\% expand(type, size, year)

all \%>\% dplyr::anti_join(fruits)

# Use with `right_join()` to fill in missing rows
fruits \%>\% dplyr::right_join(all)

# Use with `group_by()` to expand within each group
fruits \%>\% dplyr::group_by(type) \%>\% expand(year, size)
